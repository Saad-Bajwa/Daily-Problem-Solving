## Output Format
Not specified

## Example Test Cases
```json
[]
```

## Solution
```python
import sys

# Read the input
input_data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split('\n')

# First line is the number of nodes
n = int(input_data[0])

# Followed by n-1 lines of edges
edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in input_data[1:n]]

# Construct adjacency list from edges
graph = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
for u, v in edges:
    graph[u].append(v)
    graph[v].append(u)

# To store visited nodes
visited = [False] * (n + 1)

# To perform DFS
def dfs(node):
    visited[node] = True
    subtree_size = 1
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            subtree_size += dfs(neighbor)
    return subtree_size

# Find the size of the subtree rooted at each node and also keep track of the total size
total_size = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if not visited[i]:  # Not visited means it's a root of a new component
        total_size += dfs(i)

print(total_size)
```
