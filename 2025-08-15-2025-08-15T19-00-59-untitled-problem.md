[]
```

## Solution
```python
import sys

input_data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split('\n')

# Parse input
n = int(input_data[0])
cities = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in input_data[1:n+1]]
start_city = tuple(map(int, input_data[n+1].split()))

# Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest path from the start_city
import heapq

# Define the graph as a dictionary
graph = {}
for x, y, cost in cities:
    if (x, y) in graph:
        graph[(x, y)].append(cost)
    else:
        graph[(x, y)] = [cost]

# Initialize distances and priority queue
min_heap = []
heapq.heappush(min_heap, (0, start_city))  # (cost, city)
visited = set()
min_cost = {start_city: 0}

while min_heap:
    current_cost, current_city = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
    if current_city in visited:
        continue
    visited.add(current_city)

    # Explore neighbors
    for neighbor, costs in graph.items():
        if current_city == neighbor:
            continue
        for cost in costs:
            next_city = neighbor
            new_cost = current_cost + cost
            if next_city not in min_cost or new_cost < min_cost[next_city]:
                min_cost[next_city] = new_cost
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (new_cost, next_city))

# Prepare output
result = [(city[0], city[1], min_cost[city]) for city in min_cost.keys()]
result.sort()
for res in result:
    print(f'{res[0]} {res[1]} {res[2]}')
```
