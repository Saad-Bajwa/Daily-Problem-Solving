## Example Test Cases
```json
[]
```

## Solution
```python
import sys

input_data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split('\n')

# Parsing the first line as the number of elements in the array
n = int(input_data[0])

# The next line contains the elements of the array
arr = list(map(int, input_data[1].split()))

# The line after that contains the target sum we are looking for
target = int(input_data[2])

# A set to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far
seen = set()
found = False

# Loop through each number in the array
for num in arr:
    complement = target - num
    if complement in seen:
        print(f'{complement},{num}')
        found = True
        break
    seen.add(num)

# If no pair is found, we can indicate that too
if not found:
    print('No pair found')
```
