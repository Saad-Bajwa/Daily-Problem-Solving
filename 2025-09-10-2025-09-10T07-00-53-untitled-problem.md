## Input Format
Not specified

## Output Format
Not specified

## Example Test Cases
```json
[]
```

## Solution
```python
import sys

# Reading the input from stdin
input_data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split('\n')

# Parsing the first line as integer n
n = int(input_data[0])
# Parsing the second line as a list of integers arr
arr = list(map(int, input_data[1].split()))

# Implementing a function to find the minimum difference

def minimum_difference(arr, n):
    # If the array is empty or has only one element
    if n < 2:
        return 0
    arr.sort()  # Sort the array to make finding minimum difference easier
    min_diff = float('inf')  # Initialize min_diff to a very large number

    # Check consecutive elements in the sorted array for the minimum difference
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff

    return min_diff

# Call the function and get the result
result = minimum_difference(arr, n)

# Print the result
print(result)
```
