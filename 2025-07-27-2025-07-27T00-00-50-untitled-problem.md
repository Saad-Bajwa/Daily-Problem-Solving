## Input Format
Not specified

## Output Format
Not specified

## Example Test Cases
```json
[]
```

## Solution
```python
import sys

# Read the input
input_data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split('\n')

# Parse the input according to the format
n = int(input_data[0])  # First line contains the integer n
arr = list(map(int, input_data[1].split()))  # Second line contains n integers

# Implementing the logic to find the maximum sum of a subsequence with no adjacent elements
if n == 0:
    print(0)
else:
    include = arr[0]  # Max sum including the first element
    exclude = 0  # Max sum excluding the first element

    for i in range(1, n):
        # Current max excluding i
        new_exclude = max(include, exclude)

        # Current max including i
        include = exclude + arr[i]
        exclude = new_exclude

    # Result is the maximum of including or excluding the last element
    print(max(include, exclude))
```
