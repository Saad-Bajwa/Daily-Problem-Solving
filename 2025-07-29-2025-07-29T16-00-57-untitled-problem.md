```

## Solution
```python
import sys

input_data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split('\n')
n = int(input_data[0])
cities = [input_data[i].split() for i in range(1, n + 1)]

# Function to calculate the cost of connecting two cities
def connection_cost(city1, city2):
    x1, y1 = map(int, city1[1:])
    x2, y2 = map(int, city2[1:])
    return abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)

# Prim's algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree
def min_cost_to_connect_cities(cities):
    import heapq
    n = len(cities)
    # Store the minimum cost to connect to the MST
    min_cost = [float('inf')] * n
    min_cost[0] = 0
    visited = [False] * n
    # Min-heap priority queue
    priority_queue = [(0, 0)]  # (cost, city_index)
    total_cost = 0

    while priority_queue:
        cost, current = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
        if visited[current]:
            continue
        visited[current] = True
        total_cost += cost

        for neighbor in range(n):
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                cost_to_connect = connection_cost(cities[current], cities[neighbor])
                if cost_to_connect < min_cost[neighbor]:
                    min_cost[neighbor] = cost_to_connect
                    heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (cost_to_connect, neighbor))

    return total_cost

# Calculate and print the minimum cost
min_cost = min_cost_to_connect_cities(cities)
print(min_cost)
```
