## Output Format
Not specified

## Example Test Cases
```json
[]
```

## Solution
```python
import sys

input_data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split('\n')

# Parsing the inputs
n = int(input_data[0])  # The number of elements
arr = list(map(int, input_data[1].split()))  # The array elements

# We need to find the maximum sum of a subsequence which is not adjacent
if n == 0:
    print(0)
elif n == 1:
    print(arr[0])
else:
    # Initialize two variables to store inclusive and exclusive sums
    inclusive = arr[0]  # Initializing with the first element
    exclusive = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Temporary variable to store the inclusive sum for the current element
        new_inclusive = exclusive + arr[i]
        # Update exclusive to max of previous inclusive and exclusive
        exclusive = max(inclusive, exclusive)
        # Update inclusive sum
        inclusive = new_inclusive
    
    # The result will be the maximum of inclusive and exclusive
    print(max(inclusive, exclusive))
```
