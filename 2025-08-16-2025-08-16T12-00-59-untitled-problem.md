## Problem Description
No description available

## Input Format
Not specified

## Output Format
Not specified

## Example Test Cases
```json
[]
```

## Solution
```python
import sys

# Read input
input_data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split('\n')

# Assuming the format of the input is known, for example:
# First line is an integer n, second line is a list of n integers
# Read the first line as an integer n
n = int(input_data[0])

# Read the second line as a list of integers arr
arr = list(map(int, input_data[1].split()))

# We now will perform some example operation, e.g., calculate the sum
# Here, we are assuming the problem requires calculating the sum of the integers in the array.
total_sum = sum(arr)

# Print the result
print(total_sum)
```
