## Example Test Cases
```json
[]
```

## Solution
```python
import sys

input_data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split('\n')

# Read number of occurrences
n = int(input_data[0])

# Read the next 'n' lines as occurrences of characters
occurrences = input_data[1:n + 1]

# Dictionary to store the counts of characters
char_count = {}

for occurrence in occurrences:
    for char in occurrence:
        if char in char_count:
            char_count[char] += 1
        else:
            char_count[char] = 1

# Sort characters by their occurrence count (highest first), then by alphabetical order
sorted_chars = sorted(char_count.items(), key=lambda item: (-item[1], item[0]))

# Output the sorted characters along with their counts
for char, count in sorted_chars:
    print(f'{char}: {count}')
```
