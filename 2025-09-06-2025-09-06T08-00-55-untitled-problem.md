## Output Format
Not specified

## Example Test Cases
```json
[]
```

## Solution
```python
import sys

# Read input from standard input
input_data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split('\n')

# Parse the first line as integer n
n = int(input_data[0])

# Parse the second line as a list of integers
arr = list(map(int, input_data[1].split()))

# Parse the target value from the third line
target = int(input_data[2])

# Create a dictionary to store seen numbers
seen = {}

# Variable to track if we found a pair
found = False

# Iterate through each number in the array
for i in range(n):
    current_num = arr[i]
    # Calculate the number we need to find a pair that sums to target
    required_num = target - current_num
    
    # Check if required_num is in seen dictionary
    if required_num in seen:
        # If found, print the indices (1-based)
        print(seen[required_num], i + 1)
        found = True
        break
    # Store the current number's index in the seen dictionary
    seen[current_num] = i + 1  # Store 1-based index

# If no pair was found, output that as well
if not found:
    print('-1')
```
