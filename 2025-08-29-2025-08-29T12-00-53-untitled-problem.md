## Output Format
Not specified

## Example Test Cases
```json
[]
```

## Solution
```python
import sys

input_data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split('\n')

# The first line contains two integers n and k
n, k = map(int, input_data[0].split())

# The second line contains the array elements
arr = list(map(int, input_data[1].split()))

# We need to find the number of pairs with product equal to k
count = 0

# We will use a dictionary to store the frequency of each element
frequency = {}
for num in arr:
    if num in frequency:
        frequency[num] += 1
    else:
        frequency[num] = 1

# Now find pairs such that they multiply to k
for num in arr:
    if k % num == 0:  # num must be a factor of k
        complement = k // num
        if complement in frequency:
            count += frequency[complement]
            # If num and complement are the same, we should reduce the count by 1
            if complement == num:
                count -= 1

# Since every pair is counted twice (once for each order), we divide by 2
print(count // 2)
```
