## Input Format
Not specified

## Output Format
Not specified

## Example Test Cases
```json
[]
```

## Solution
```python
import sys

# Read the input
input_data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split('\n')

# Parse the input
n = int(input_data[0])
s = list(map(int, input_data[1].split()))

# The algorithm to find the minimum number of steps to make all elements equal to their average
# For this, we need to calculate the average and round it to the nearest integer
average = sum(s) / n
rounded_average = round(average)

# Count how many steps are needed to make all elements equal to the rounded average
steps = sum(abs(x - rounded_average) for x in s)

# Since we can increase or decrease the elements, the total number of operations is steps / 2
# because each operation can change two units (either +1 or -1)
print(steps // 2)
```
