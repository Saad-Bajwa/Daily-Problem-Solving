## Output Format
Not specified

## Example Test Cases
```json
[]
```

## Solution
```python
import sys

input_data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split('\n')

# Extracting the number of nodes, edges and the list of edges from the input
d = list(map(int, input_data[0].split()))
n = d[0]
m = d[1]
edges = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in input_data[1:m + 1]]

from collections import defaultdict

# Building the adjacency list for the graph
graph = defaultdict(list)
for u, v in edges:
    graph[u].append(v)
    graph[v].append(u)  # If the graph is undirected

# Function to perform DFS and count connected components
def dfs(node, visited):
    stack = [node]
    while stack:
        current = stack.pop()
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                stack.append(neighbor)

# Counting connected components
visited = set()
components_count = 0

for node in range(1, n + 1):
    if node not in visited:
        # If the node has not been visited, start a DFS from there
        visited.add(node)
        dfs(node, visited)
        components_count += 1

print(components_count)
```
